# Satellite

Satellite is a Python application that creates a bridge between Asterisk PBX and Deepgram speech recognition services. It connects to Asterisk ARI (Asterisk REST Interface) and waits for channels to enter stasis. When a channel enters stasis with the application name "satellite", it creates a snoop channel and sends external media to its RTP server address. The RTP server distinguishes various channels from the UDP source port, captures the audio, and forwards it to Deepgram for real-time speech-to-text transcription. Transcription results are then published to an MQTT broker for further processing. If OpenAI API key is provided, it will be used to generate a summary of the transcriptions.

## Voicemail transcription

Voicemail transcription is enabled by setting the environment variable `SATELLITE_VOICEMAIL_TRANSCRIPTION_ENABLED` to `True` (also on NS8 interface)
`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` should be set to a valid Deepgram API key

The extension should have:
- voicemail enabled
- voicemail email configured
- voicemail email attachment enabled

The voicemail transcription is added to the voicemail message body and saved in the voicemessages_transcriptions table.

## Call transcription

Call transcription is enabled by setting the environment variable `SATELLITE_CALL_TRANSCRIPTION_ENABLED` to `True` (also on NS8 interface)
`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` should be set to a valid Deepgram API key
`OPENAI_API_KEY` should be set to a valid OpenAI API key (For the call summary, optional)

Calls are transcribed in real time and the transcription is published to an MQTT broker for further processing.

On topic `satellite/transcription` real time transcription is published.
Example:

```
satellite/transcription {"uniqueid": "1750153516.571", "transcription": "Prova", "timestamp": 17.1, "speaker_name": "Foo 1", "speaker_number": "201", "is_final": false}
satellite/transcription {"uniqueid": "1750153516.571", "transcription": "Prova", "timestamp": 17.1, "speaker_name": "Foo 1", "speaker_number": "201", "is_final": true}
``

On topic `satellite/final` final transcription and summary are published.
Example:
```
satellite/final {"uniqueid": "1750153516.571", "raw_transcription": "\nFoo 1: Prova\nprova prova\nfunzioni allora\n"}
satellite/final {"uniqueid": "1750153516.571", "clean_transcription": "Foo 1: Prova  \nProva prova  \nFunzioni allora  "}
satellite/final {"uniqueid": "1750153516.571", "summary": "- Foo 1: \"Prova\"\n- \"prova prova\"\n- \"funzioni allora\""}
```
